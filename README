2. BSP Kernel and Distros
=========================

The following table summarizes the valid Wind River Linux distros for this BSP.
'Y' in each content cell stands for supported; 'N' stands for not supported:

  +--------------+-------------+-------------+------------------+
  | valid/distro |   wrlinux   | wrlinux-cgl | wrlinux-std-sato |
  +--------------+-------------+-------------+------------------+
  |    valid     |      Y      |      N      |         y        |
  +--------------+-------------+-------------+------------------+

For the supported kernel type for this BSP, check the TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES
by running 'bitbake -e | grep "^TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES"'.


3. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP,
along with patch descriptions, use git to see what changed on the default
kernel (git whatchanged <kernel_type>..<bsp_name>). For example:

	# cd path_to_project/tmp-glibc/work-shared/xilinx-zynqmp/kernel-source
	# git whatchanged standard/base..HEAD


4. Boot Instructions
====================

You must load the DTB (device tree blob) into the target's memory
prior to booting the kernel Image. The DTB file can be found in the export
directory after building a project, or you can generate it manually with the
following commands:

        # bitbake -c devshell virtual/kernel
        # vim arch/arm64/boot/dts/xilinx/the_file_you_edit*.dts
	# make xilinx/zynqmp-zcu102-rev1.0.dtb

The resulting DTB file can be found here:
path_to_project/build/tmp-glibc/work/<bsp name>-wrs-linux/linux-yocto/<kernel version>/linux-<bsp name>-<kernel type>-build/arch/arm64/boot/dts/xilinx/

Assuming all files can be downloaded from a network, deploy your board and host
properly to ensure your network is available from the board.

4.1 Boot from SD card
---------------------

4.1.1 Deploy kernel, DTB image and file system image into your SD card
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Refer to the bootloader/README for information on how to make an SD
bootable card. Deploy the kernel image, DTB image and file system image as follows:

	# mount /dev/mmcblk0p2 /mnt/sd
	# tar xfj wrlinux-image-glibc-std-xilinx-zynqmp.tar.bz2 --numeric-owner -C /mnt/sd
	# umount /mnt/sd
	# mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt/sd
	# cp path_to_Image /mnt/sd/boot
	# cp path_to_zynqmp-zcu102-rev1.0.dtb /mnt/sd/boot
	# umount /mnt/sd

4.2.2 Set the u-boot environment variables and boot from SD card
----------------------------------------------------------------

Run the following command to load the kernel image and DTB image:

	=> setenv bootargs console=ttyPS0,115200 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootwait earlycon=cdns,mmio,0xFF000000 clk_ignore_unused
	=> mmc rescan
	=> fatload mmc 0 0x10000000 Image
	=> fatload mmc 0 0x11800000 zynqmp-zcu102-rev1.0.dtb
	=> booti 0x10000000 - 0x11800000

4.2 NFS boot
------------

4.2.1 Setup configuration your NFS TFTP server, and deploy the rootfs tarball
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	# sudo tar jxf wrlinux-image-std-sato-xilinx-zynqmp.tar.bz2 -C path_to_rootfs

4.2.2 Set the u-boot environment variables and boot from NFS
------------------------------------------------------------

	=> setenv bootargs console=ttyPS0,115200 earlycon=cdns,mmio,0xFF000000 clk_ignore_unused root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=serverip:path_root_rootfs ip=dhcp
	=> tftpboot 0x10000000 Image; tftpboot 0x11800000 dtb; booti 0x10000000 - 0x11800000

5. WIC Notes
============

User can use the OpenEmbedded Image Creator to create the properly partitioned
image on a SD card. It generates partitioned images from existing OpenEmbedded
build artifacts. Please refer to the following URL for more detailed partition
information about WIC:

https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.6/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#creating-partitioned-images-using-wic

After having built your project, a partitioned WIC image will be created in the
deploy folder as follows:

  path_to_your_project/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/xilinx-zynqmp/wrlinux-image-glic-<rootfs_type>-xilinx-zynqmp.wic

There are two partitions in this WIC images, the first one is to hold the boot
images, the second is the related root file system.

5.1 An example to deploy bootloader into the first partition
------------------------------------------------------------

1) Deploy the created WIC image into SD card(/dev/sdx) in your host machine.

   $ sudo dd if=wrlinux-image-glibc-<rootfs_type>-xilinx-zynqmp.wic of=/dev/sdx

2) Download binary bootloader from the vendor website, and deploy BOOT.BIN into
   /dev/sdx1

   $ sudo mount /dev/sdx1 path_to_sdx1
   $ cp -r path_to_your_bootloader/BOOT.BIN path_to_sdx1
   $ sync; sudo umount path_to_sdx1

5.2 Boot the board from the WIC SD card
---------------------------------------

Insert the SD card into the board and power on, then set the proper u-boot
environment parameters to boot the board, please refer to section 4 for more
information.

Board can boot automatically by set the below uboot environment variables:

=> setenv bootfile Image; setenv fdtfile zynqmp-zcu102-rev1.0.dtb;  setenv loadaddr 0x10000000; setenv fdtaddr 0x11800000;

=> setenv bootargs 'root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootdelay=5 console=ttyPS0,115200n8'

=> setenv bootcmd 'fatload mmc 0:1 $loadaddr $bootfile; fatload mmc 0:1 $fdtaddr $fdtfile; booti $loadaddr - $fdtaddr';

=> saveenv; run bootcmd;
